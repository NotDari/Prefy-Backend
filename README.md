# Prefy Backend

A Spring Boot backend service for Prefy - an android application that was previously on the google play store.

## Note from the Developer

This project was developed in 2023, prior to major formal coding education, when I was coding mostly self taught.  
At the time, my practices around testing, commenting, and secure handling of credentials were less mature.

Since then, Iâ€™ve improved my development habits significantly, including:

- Writing thorough tests
- Adding meaningful comments and documentation
- Structuring projects more cleanly
- Handling sensitive data securely

I'm in the process of going back and amending my mistakes throughout this project, and so while this project represents my ambition,
it doesn't fully represent my current ability and practices.
